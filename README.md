Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Advice API
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to connect an API to a web app and get information from the server.  

The button position gave me some trouble, but when I took it out of the same container as the text, it was a lot easier to maneuver and keep in line with the whole container. 

### Continued development

I'd like to make more generators like this.  i would also like to add the functionality that lets me go back, save advice, and even look up by particular advice id. 

I've created some special styles with Yoda today.  I want to make a few other profiles that users can switch between that updates the styles and colors.
